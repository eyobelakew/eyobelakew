# Hello, World! 👋

I'm Eyob Lakew, a passionate problem solver and tech enthusiast. Welcome to my digital haven, where I thrive on creative problem-solving and a commitment to lifelong learning.

## About Me

- 💻 **Coding:** My journey into programming began in a high school classroom, and since then, I've been continuously learning the art of programming and honing my problem-solving skills.

- 🌐 **Web Development:** I possess a solid understanding of fundamental concepts, including HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript. Proficient in frameworks such as React and Express.

- 📱 **App Development:** Witnessing my applications run successfully on my mobile device is one of the most gratifying experiences. I build mobile apps using Flutter and React

- 🧠 **Machine Learning:** I see my future unfolding in machine learning, particularly passionate about image processing. I've gained experience analyzing MRI images to detect variations in tissue density and unexpected structural changes.

## Interests

- 📚 **Books:** Books have been my guides in the art of living. Through their words, I've learned to navigate life's challenges, cultivate resilience, and pursue my goals with greater clarity and determination.

- 🎬 **Movies:** Movies are my guilty pleasure, especially after a demanding week. There's nothing like sinking into a comfy couch and letting a good comedy movie wash away all the stress.
